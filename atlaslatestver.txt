v2.4.1^v2.4.1 Added Show/Hide Atlas servers from the task bar
- Fixed: Atlas update checker.  Due to changes in how Steam reports latest version, I re-wrote the entire update-checker code.  It should be compatible with most any future changes. (Thanks to Infiniti for reporting)
- Added: User-definable server branch which will allow for beta version downloads. Default branch is public.  (Thanks to Infiniti for requesting)
- Fixed: ASUU sometimes tried to download redis-cli using 7z.dll, causing error.
